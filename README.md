# SNAKE GAME

I've build a simple snake game. A snake is displayed on the screen and grows each time he eat the fruit that is displayed. The score updates by 10 each time the snake eats. The user can move accross the walls. Bitting the tail causes the snakes dead and ends the game.

## Key Features

- Snakes speed : 200ms;
- Snake crosses the wall and can grow very long;
- Food appears randomly on the screen

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## What's next?

- Reduce the length of my code (mainly JS);
- Add limited number of lives to the snake;
- Display a game menu;
- Add some new levels to increase the difficulty;
- Save the highest scores of the players.
